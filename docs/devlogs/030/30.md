- [8ed25ab](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/8ed25ab8f6586d16af05477648f847f3c99e15c1): I realized that `li`s were being positioned super incorrectly (the box was ~20px to the left of where it should be). I discovered this because I was trying to implement hovering and added a `background-color` to `li` when hovered, which showed the box and the text were not aligned.
- [6e9f441](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/6e9f4411e34ba8e5d1acdf67879a3834b35f8b94): Made elements have associated styles rather than boxes, because boxes having associated styles makes hovering way more complicated to implement.
- [18d27e5](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/18d27e5c65fa50e4dac1fc3efa5f7da3705ff361): After a ton of debugging and almost rewriting my entire text rendering engine, I implemented proper hovering. This style:
```css
h1:hover {
  color: red;
}
```
Now actually makes `h1`s red only on hover.

# Next Steps
---
1. Implement underlines?
2. Make links work?

## Note
---
This was a ton of work, the basis of hovering (detecting which elements are hovered) was pretty easy but applying styles only on hover was the bulk of this devlog.
