# Changes

- [90b6c62](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/90b6c6215ee0bae1b4ae68de72d7876d8e43a282): My codebase used to have a parser struct for parsing CSS, which I decided to refactor out into just functions since it didn't really need to maintain any state. I thought about doing the same to the HTML parser, but it does maintain some state (current tokens) so I left it as is for now.
- [182e138](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/182e138c1f71111ce6c0abf4e98396eb5f53fdde): Boring commit. Was mostly just me reading through the CSS spec and trying to understand how to implement the various parsing algorithms.
- [d002d3d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/d002d3d4b8a8b933e3f74439e233ae7d60d18484): I started working on serializing values back to text because something in the CSS spec mentioned that certain properties need to be serialized in a specific way. I hate this so much.

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Finish serialization.
2. Implement more CSS spec.
3. Start implement cascading and inheritance.
---
## Note
---
This is probably one of the most boring updates I've ever written. CSS parsing is just not very exciting. It's a whole lot of reading through poorly written specs with conflicting wording and trying to implement them. It's so boring that I don't really have anything to show for it.
