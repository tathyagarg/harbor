- [5fb1292](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/5fb1292e938668dfdc338c6ca5082b54dd06df2e): As promised, I worked on IPv4, opaque and domain parsing. That concludes the host parsing algorithm, it was a LOT lengthier than expected;
- [7728d02](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/7728d023e6ce7133cb8b965d142bcd98ea2e2dfc): I completed the ENTIRE [URL parsing specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing)'s implementation. This took WAY TOO LONG. Seriously, there's no way parsing a URL is THAT deep. For reference, the entire implementation spans almost 1500 lines, consisting 4 different individual parsers (IPv6, IPv4, Opaque, Host), 5 different encoding sets, 27 different custom errors, that all come together with a 600 line long state machine to parse a URL.
