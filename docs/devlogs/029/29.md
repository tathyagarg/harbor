# Changes
---
- [eb86c45](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/eb86c45e92cee4bc8838b98260adca480ab5a908): My code was trimming all leading and trailing whitespace from HTML content, which caused issues with things like `<p><a>Link</a> to something</p>` being rendered without a space between "Link" and "to". Fixed it by trimming left or right whitespace only when the child is the first or last child, respectively.
- [d49038f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/d49038f9ec9816e623f134e6403496b354a412b5): I added margin collapsing, which is when vertical margins of block elements collapse into a single margin. Also fixed a bug with items not being popped from the parents stack at all.
- [2fee9db](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/2fee9db04c0e97a07c5e0cb509e85afb1a76aec9): I added the `list-item` display type, which is used for `li`s. This took SO long because I tried to make it once, and it just refused to work for some reason. So I stashed all my changes and started over from scratch, and it worked after a while. I ran into a bug where bullets where being rendered as ellipses rather than circles, which I fixed by properly converting to clips space.

1. I really don't know right now.

The screenshot in this devlog is from [jmeow.net](https://jmeow.net)! The last bit of JavaScript being rendered is because my browser doesn't understand that `script` tags shouldn't be rendered.
