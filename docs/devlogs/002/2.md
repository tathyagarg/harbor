# Changes
---
- [0784aeb](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/0784aebcb62d4bd168a102f3f6d976e977fc2fa2): Started work on the HTTP client that will be sending requests and receiving responses. The next commit should have the actual sending moved into a separate function so that different HTTP Protocols can send requests differently.

- [ba895e8](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/ba895e85706d86f58dd9ee9267e49688dfebdc8c): I added integrity checks to requests, different send methods depending on protocol, basic response decoding (only enough for HTTP/0.9 for now), and a basic Client struct so you can specify an address once and send requests to it multiple times

---

# Next Steps
---

1. Implement response handling for HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
2. Look into adding support for HTTPS
