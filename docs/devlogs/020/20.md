# Changes
---
- [8f47563](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/8f47563984b869d5c258affc415bd5924ab08a9f): I refactored the code base so that text renderers have their own vertex buffer objects which they write to. Should hopefully improve performance when rendering multiple text objects.
- [ef4a97f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/ef4a97fcd8f45b9de6a65645fa7c9b8ca2d339f7): Did some more refactoring, but this time to improve the layout structure I have. I refactored text renderers a little more so they're now font-specific rather than text-specific. Also the layout system allows for multiple available fonts and sizes via separate text renderers.

# Next Steps
---
1. The layout system is kind of like absolute positioning right now. I want to implement a more flexible layout system that allows for relative positioning and alignment.
