# Changes

- [f351b9c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/f351b9c6e19c376b1e8717fbf358cfee27176126): I moved from calling DNS resolution functions independently to having a DNS resolver which caches resolved addresses and does cache invalidation after a TTL is elapsed.
- [d443140](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/d44314071338ed6abc03669970cd9899fe42b008): Added automatic redirect following, so responses with status code 3XX automatically trigger a redirect check
- [abea778](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/abea778603a7689d80c3ba759bf54f1142d909f4): Started work on the HTML stuff by adding some structures I saw in the [official HTML5 specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).
---
# Next steps
---
1. Ignore most of the remaining structures/traits (*and the stuff I marked as TODO*), and go straight into the HTML parser
---
## Notes
---
Maybe trying to start with expressing the entire HTML spec in code wasn't the best idea. I don't like leaving things mid-way but I don't really see another way out here, at least for now.
