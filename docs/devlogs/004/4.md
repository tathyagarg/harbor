# Changes

- [bc11bca](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/bc11bca3007d8c25a07f685b55ea57e2dbd85bd8), [076345e](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/076345eb43db650863e6010fdcf1f836057b2f7c): I added basic DNS resolution so you don't have to type in IP addresses when sending requests, and can just write a domain/hostname
- [17ad97c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/17ad97c85290f40eeb013a48ec920f29136842ef): I abstracted streams away into a trait allowing me to implement a new kind of stream which supports TLS, which means I can now send and receive responses with HTTPS!

# Next steps
---
1. DNS caching and cache invalidation
2. Maybe some work on the rendering?
