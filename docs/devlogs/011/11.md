# Changes
---
- [e1a25d6](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/e1a25d622b165818cd103ae6754eee4edf334cd8): I left out adding `list of active formatting elements`, so I finally added it here. It was a lot more annoying that I thought it would be.
- [afb2530](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/afb2530d472b471d89ca7a9f833de783415be178): I refactored most of my codebase to make use of Rc<Refcell<>> instead of Box<> and other shitty workarounds. The code is a lot... fatter? now. But it is also a lot cleaner and easier to work with. I also got started with the 7th state and it's going well, I noticed a bug from the refactor but I couldn't be bothered to fix it as of now.

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Complete the 7th state (the "in body" state).
2. Trace the bug that I noticed after the refactor and fix.

The attachment is ~90 lines of an almost 300 line long tree structure that I use to represent the DOM!
