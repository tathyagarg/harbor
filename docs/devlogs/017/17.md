- [db4c07f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/db4c07f9b4fb2623e358fc5883571a3e65b52081), [cca929f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/cca929f7647bcb22be65f971366c5809bbf176bb): I implemented the `post` and `loca` tables. I uniquely remember enjoying writing the `post` table's code, I don't know why. `loca` was pretty boring.
- [4016b3e](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/4016b3e05b4caff9f62c21735fb838e6b13d8b23), [399c66a](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/399c66a8d2974c3da55ad45b902d0cd6d0eb5ae8): I added the most important table, `glyf`. This table was a pain to implement. I had to individually implement both simple and composite glyphs. Composites were especially tricky because there wasn't a well defined structure for them in the docs.
- [5681a6a](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/5681a6a421d8c5d7df20c476f12fbc87f8f9b6f8), [80b8865](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/80b88658637611e2cf23b0abad22330d278f9b95): I implemented 5 more tables, `cvt`, `fpgm`, `prep`, `gasp` and `meta`. I'm almost done adding tables - there's only a couple left (4 more that I plan on implementing).

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Implement the remaining tables: `hdmx`, `kern`, `vhea`, `vmtx`.
2. Consider adding support for AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) tables like `bsln`, `feat`, etc. (probably won't)
3. Start with the rendering engine - this will be a big task.
