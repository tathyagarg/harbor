# Changes
---
- [7c7cefe](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/7c7cefe420fbb99bcadcd71c61269ac65c61e58a): I added the HDMX table - just for funsies.
- [5eb379b](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/5eb379b2d17a4097a1c1e9b6c0fc088f7aafd80a): I did some basic work on the render pipeline so I could actually start rendering glyphs. I did a really messy merge right before this, so I can't really explain the details of the changes.
- [c227220](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/c2272200a145ba31363c6e08ed9557e4b61e85e3): I fixed the parsing for the `glyf` table. There was barely anything done correctly when I first wrote it, but I had no way of telling until I tried rendering. This took **WAY TOO LONG**. I *think* the core of the issue was that x- and y-coordinates are stored as deltas, not absolute values. I refactored the codebase to hold contours rather than raw points, so that may have somehow solved part of the issue too.
- [bf3d0c9](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/bf3d0c9ac7e1c04255d06be9c19611cf5c4c34ab): I realized I needed to use a `LineList` rather than a `LineStrip` to render the contours properly. A `LineStrip` connects the last point to the first point automatically, which is not what I wanted (it would connect points from different contours).
- [efbef46](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/efbef468ff4361fe38f84664d601711076c8bd6c): I completely forgot that I had to handle bezier curves in the glyph rendering. So I added that functionality in. It seems to be working fine now. I do need to find a way to dynamically calculate a decent precision for the curves.

# Next Steps
---
1. Fill in the glyphs so they're not just outlines.
2. Implement rendering of composite glyphs.
3. Implement rendering multiple glyphs (i.e. words, sentences).
