- [f0f4b470](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/f0f4b4707afe1031497565d8daf8ba36dfe7cd72): I decided that my old implementation of some of the structs in the HTML specification was not very good, so I rewrote them. This should make future changes easier. Along with this, I started working on the HTML parser again - this time on the tree construction stage.
- [951e074e](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/951e074e48f4bdc102789327ca9998c4eb9559b7): I completed the first 2 insertion mods states in the tree construction stage of the HTML parser.
- [db893cd](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/db893cdf639c0e1f34fcaf05054e49ea7c853bd6): Not very eventful, I just added a few more insertion modes to the HTML parser's tree construction stage.
- [19f26fe](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/19f26fedb15797eb1158a60d188ef56cbc9bcaaa): I added 2 more insertion modes (6 total now), and also properly implemented a function that I've been meaning to implement for a while now (`_appropriate_insertion_place`). Refactoring my code to support this function was very satisfying.

# Next Steps
---
1. Continue implementing more insertion modes for the HTML parser's tree construction stage.
