# Harbor Browser
Harbor Browser is going to be a browser where I write every major service myself. This means everything from:
- HTTP client
- HTML/CSS parser and renderer
- JS interpreter

And anything else a traditional browser would have must be written by me. I'm trying to limit myself to as few dependencies as possible.

## Progress
I decided to use `winit` and `wgpu` as the windowing and GPU abstraction layers. They'll be doing a lot of the heavy lifting for this project, I suspect. I got a basic window opening and cleared with a color. It doesn't sound like much but that was 250 lines of code :|
