# Changes
---
- [1bc896d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/1bc896d748549550960ad78498189b9b582672b8): I implemented the `_adoption_agency` function which means `a` tags (along with all the other formatting tags) are now being properly serialized. Honestly I'm super sceptical about this implementation but it seems to be working fine for now. I'm too scared to test it.

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Possibly a deserialization to serialize the DOM into HTML.
2. Actually start on rendering the DOM?
