(*Holy refactor*)
# Changes
---
- [e2e8c8c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/e2e8c8cbd538f2705d8ce5f508c051d6c00ee8c2): The bugs with layout from the last devlog were fixed by this commit. The bug with layouts was that it was displaying multiple consecutive spaces rather than collapsing them into a single space. I also removed some redundant parameters from the layout functions.
- [bc810db](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/bc810dba808b9083980abf119f0075fa1b17aca0): Turns out margins weren't being applied correctly because boxes were ignoring them. This fixed that, along with me adding `larger` and `smaller` size keywords for CSS.
- [2847abc](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/2847abcaa91e5b9ff0a230d5c9c6a23e031a91a6): I refactored my entire text rendering system because it wasn't very well designed and probably would've been a nightmare to implement glyph filling onto. I couldn't explain all the bugs and changes I made in this commit, because there were so many. At one point my text was having an upside-down seizure where it was just jittering out of control (while upside-down?). But now everything is working perfectly.

# Next Steps
---
1. Implement glyph filling?

## Note
---
This was the most painful refactor I've done in my life. Wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.
