- [47f712d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/47f712d264ed41392ca4d39dc250a8a86df824e4): Little bit of work on the HTML spec.
- [a849fb1](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/a849fb18d0ebdc6a48645db900fd8c54df79557e): I was trying to implement the URL specification but turns out I need to implement a host spec and for that I need to implement IPv4, IPv6 and a couple other things. So I've implemented IPv6, but this devlog has been mostly just busy work that doesn't have much immediate benefit to the project.

# Next Steps
---
1. IPv4, opaque and domain parsing (basically, finish up host parsing as a whole)
2. URL parsing (I need to finish host parsing for this)
