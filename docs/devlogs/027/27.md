- [29f9e4c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/29f9e4cb4aaf3640c0186025f9252d67995193a0): I decided to start implementing the `font` properties to my CSS, so I started with creating the structures required for parsing a `font` declaration into an object.
- [6c09fe1](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/6c09fe19bd18ad8660492dfa40da813797bd5d95): I used the structures I created to implement parsing of `font` declarations. This was pretty similar to how I implemented parsing for `background` declarations.
- [0014074](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/001407456a92041e8c984309658d8e6e0c2773ef): I remembered reading about User Agent stylesheets and decided to implement support for them in Harbor. So now `assets/css/ua.css` is the user agent stylesheet that Harbor uses by default.
- [800515f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/800515f3b103c69fb42239f5651e373dd1fae921): Small fix with font size resolution so that it can now correctly resolve `rem` and `em` units. I realize as I'm writing this devlog that this means that `smaller` and `larger` keywords should also work with minimal implementation.
- [186f319](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/186f31943a6a1ecb3818dff50e125b84a44fbb14): I added actual support for `display` block and inline. Reworking the layout engine to support block and inline elements properly was really annoying because of how messy my code was (what the hell was I thinking when I wrote it??).
- [0b0f6c6](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/0b0f6c6802901bcb3cbf00386c7cf74d2218bb20): I forgot to implement system colors (`AccentColor`, etc.) in my color parser, so I added support for those.
