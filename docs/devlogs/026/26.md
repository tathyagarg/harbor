- [d86e3c7](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/d86e3c7ee37faa72d75eb994afe918987e13588b): I added background colors to boxes, and refactored the render pipeline to include a separate renderer for fillings.
- [51f0a95](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/51f0a955be78dbcf860eb6d6d0469438eda49d9a): Added the width style property too, so that boxes can have custom widths. I wanna implement overflows soon too.
- [e0c3506](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/e0c3506b924df9e83570e09defd0cb654bb9fb1b): lwk I forgot that `background-color` is a subproperty of `background-*` properties, so I refactored the codebase to accommodate that.
- [1423835](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/14238353968d6f2aaf66b2a308bda5f1a9c53384): A part of the CSS spec defines how `background` properties should be parsed, so I implemented that. Also turns out I severely misread the spec when I was first refactoring the codebase last commit and got a very wrong idea of what a background layer is. So I had to do a lot of refactoring of that too.
- [a6f6232](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/a6f62326db67a127c2fce73c9df9c510c6bd13e3): I added individual properties for all the `background`sub-properties (like `background-color`, `background-image` etc).

# Next Steps

1. Font? Maybe png parser then image rendering?

## Note
---
I'm super locked in for my exams rn, so updates might be a bit slow. But I'll try to push as much as I can.
