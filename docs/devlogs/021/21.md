- [753e436](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/753e4362048adcbd026638dd7abcae07c06e2fc8): I realized as I was copying random HTML code from the [CSS specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/) that my code doesn't always work. So I added a couple of test cases in the `tests/` directory so I have a way to verify that my code is working as expected.
- [c7f088a](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/c7f088a3f91dec003d46a4c3405e0c8d5a230763): I reworked my layout system to make use of the CSS spec more effectively. This was pretty much a complete rewrite of my layout engine, but it was super worth it when I ran the code with an example HTML file and saw that it rendered correctly!
