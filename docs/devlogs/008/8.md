- [f7eec2d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/f7eec2d583588fc42b55027061f1b78d2219b642): I added some serialization functions to all the new URL-related structures, refactored the URLPath structure to be more representative of the specification, and integrated the new URL infrastructure into my existing HTTP client code.

# Next Steps
- Implement the HTML parser (for real this time)
---
## Note
---
The next devlog is probably gonna be a BIG one, like 5+ hours minimum (most likely) - given the fact that the [HTML parser specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html) is just so LONG. I've been reading through it and the main state machine literally has 80 states and that's not even the entire specification because there's probably a billion utility functions and side quests I'll have to go on to implement it right.
