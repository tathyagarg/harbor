- [de03232](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/de032320518120c02f4964e271ee33f89e5482fb): I had a CSSRule struct which took a payload of a few types, but I realized that it'd probably be smart to take the payload in as a generic so that impl's on specific rule kinds can access the parent CSSRule object's properties. This makes it easier to implement things like serialization later on.
- [c2fe3c6](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/c2fe3c655631b5412cf5965911d435f503ab313f): Going through the spec I came across this line:
> Let parsed rule be the result of parsing rule according to the appropriate CSS specifications

With no further explanation. After digging I found that this meant I needed to implement parsing for individual rule kinds , so I started with that for the classic style rule. So, I started implementing a selector parser.
- [b8c1008](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/b8c1008cc666c45518df7ef7d3803d3c85c06c88): I completed the selector parser, which was actually pretty enjoyable. Took a while though.
- [6fc8820](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/6fc8820d6de364a5de182f9152fd637f9bea9995): Was getting ready to go sleep when I realized that I already had a block parser implemented for style rules, so I went ahead and hooked that up to the CSS parser so that style rules can be fully parsed now. YAY

# Next Steps
---
1. *MAYBE* implement more rule kinds. Not sure if I want to do that yet.
2. Cascading? Inheritance?
