# Changes
---
- [87a2cbc](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/87a2cbca2dccaa48a00aaae7b5bb9ffbe7d3340c): I refactored text rendering to use `ttc`s instead of individual `ttf` data so that bold and italics are possible. With this possibility, I implemented bold font weights.
- [49c4534](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/49c4534b177a88924c0b568f3b802bdf72afc18b): I added support for italics, and bold italics. I should probably add the `<b>` and `<i>` tags now.
- [4aeb201](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/4aeb201e5a0e18653cafeae97b8f68ac6313cf7c): Headings were feeling super cramped, so I added support for the `margin` CSS property. Also added basic support for `margin-*` properties (`margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-right`). I added these margins onto headings in the `ua.css`. The style rule for `h1` now looks like this:
```css
h1 {
  display: block;
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin: 0.67em 0;
}
```

# Next Steps
---
1. Implement `<b>` and `<i>` tags.
2. Add support for more CSS properties (padding? border?).
