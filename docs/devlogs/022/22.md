- [391bcdd](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/391bcddeb9ffd33baa94ee9340dbae76f45b1ca8): I started working on CSS, starting with a tokenizer. This should've been really simple but the [CSS spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#tokenization) is just really weirdly worded. Got stuck on the stupidest bug ever for like an hour, I was reading the current and next character instead of the next 2 characters.

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Finish the CSS parser.
2. Write tests for the CSS tokenizer.
