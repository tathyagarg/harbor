(*Micro devlog*)
# Changes
---
- [b753d4c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/b753d4c286f3df333ebf99e69d6c72428f63fab9): I added parsing for `OS/2` and `name` tables, though the `name` table parsing only supports version 0 currently.

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Finish `post` table parsing.
---
## Note
---
I really only made this devlog because it pushes me over the 60h mark for this project.
