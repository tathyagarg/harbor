# Changes

- [3018fe0](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/3018fe00e5c87619271d584e1d13bdb502f72d73): I made it so that when the HTML parser encounters a `</style>` it automatically reads the contents of the style tag and tries to parse it as a `CSSStyleSheet`, and adds it to a vec of stylesheets
- [329a395](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/329a39548e0cf5720ec2e58f95560476c44984e4): I added specificity calculations for selectors. I'm not using this as of now because my first priority was linking CSS into the render process.
- [ed2b385](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/ed2b38540f4324342afe2377dcd688d3d3956f6d): I added a `ComputedStyle` struct which stores data about the actual styles that an element should use when rendered. I used a depth-first traversal to go through the DOM and try to compute styles based on selector matches for every element.
- [e4ca0bb](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/e4ca0bb3e1f2cc09d0af85e9a986339796120f28): Linked element computed styles into the Layout Box engine, and hooked that into the actual rendering pipeline. Seeing the red text was crazy.

# Next Steps
---
1. Change colors to take an alpha value and implement color functions?
2. Hook up margins, paddings, borders from CSS to the layout engine
