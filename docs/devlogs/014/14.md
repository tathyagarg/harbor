- [375abc7](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/375abc7415b1ccd91db4397967fb7ad8bb393aab): I decided that I'm going to write my own font parsing library. I saw Sebastian Lague's video on font rendering and it inspired me to try it out myself. I created some basic structs and functions that will help me parse font files and extract glyph data. I'm using MacOS's `/System/Library/Fonts/Times.ttc` as my test font file for now.
- [ad91bfd](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/ad91bfdebabac4f29059da28594e32d5c9d129c0): I implemented basic parsing, so I can now parse the TTC data to get a header, and table directories. Each table directory is furhter parsed to get table records. I'm currently working on parsing the 'cmap' table to get character to glyph mappings. I've completed cmap subtable format 0 and 4 so far.

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Complete parsing of cmap table by implementing format 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12, 13, 14. I'm considering only doing format 4 and 12 for now since they cover most use cases.
2. Start work on next table to parse, likely 'glyf' table to get glyph data.
