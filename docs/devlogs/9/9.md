# Changes
---
The core theme of this devlog is the implementation of the [HTML Tokenization spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#tokenization) - comprising an absolutely enormous state machine with 80 different possible states, at least 40 different kinds of errors, and extremely poor documentation on specifics. Commit-wise breakdowns are pretty uneventful but out of habit I'll do it anyway - but with no details.
- [6d3c54d](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/6d3c54d323ff273b34764444af89b6eed4efbdf9): 21/80 states
- [fa9cb38](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/fa9cb38c2e6a4f9c60ffd9e1cc35fad96b811d1d): 33/80 states
- [3882f6c](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/3882f6c6987c62a656a04cb48746930910da5dec): 55/80 states
- [eb2aeb5](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/eb2aeb59e40dd76e34f23ed704493f84627d0573): 80/80 states + test run on tiny dummy HTML

# Next Steps
---
1. I've got my tokenizer completed, but I still need to construct a Node tree using the emitted tokens. That's what I'll be working on in the next devlog, along with implementing more parts of the HTML spec as is required.
---
## Note
---
This was probably the most boring coding session I've ever gone through. The code, like the specification, is repetitive, and can probably be modularized to oblivion. But if you think I'm voluntary touching those 2600 lines of code EVER again, you're crazy.
