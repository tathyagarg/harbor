- [809d448](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/809d4483328a5d184f68daadd65756b888ec8556): I was trying to render the [flavorless website](https://flavorless.hackclub.com) and it was refusing to work because I half-assed the HTML tree parser. So I added support for a couple more tags in the parser and completed a couple TODOs from the tokenizer (ts was a pain)
- [ca4ca6f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/ca4ca6fee1e814b969f6dba34cbb17cb982a7632): I added support for `br` tags by adding a flag for whether or not the layout engine is requesting a line switch. That works ok, but there seem to be a ton of other bugs that I need to fix (as you can probably tell from the photo)

# Next Steps
---
1. Fix as many bugs as possible from the screenshot

## Note
---
This entire devlog was just me fixing my shit codebase :yay: also ts was a smaller devlog than what I normally post because I'm super tired today. Really could not be bothered to fix the bugs today before posting this devlog.
