- [9eae3a1](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/9eae3a18873451d1a4b75a52782d3ed21b25f44c): I added response decoding using a state machine system that populates a request object as its fed data. I designed the system to be robust to an extent that even if it receives data in chunks of 8 bytes it is able to properly construct a response object.
- [c9c0f02](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/c9c0f02810b6cf763ab992a255e5daa8d83b1fb6): Added a little helper function to get a nice display of the response
