(*This devlog is mostly refactoring*)
# Changes
---
- [839d015](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/839d015fed1d6376be92cda5d170b497f731a271): I fixed a small bug in the code where certain elements were lacking parents and node documents.
- [00861d6](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/00861d65c04ab1b4effaaae5678db817fb01c67e): Refactor of all time 2, electric boogaloo: I refactored Attrs to hold Rc<RefCell<Element>> instead of Element directly. This allows for better management of element references and avoids ownership issues. It was also a massive pain in the ass to refactor.
- [871232f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/871232fd016ebb39e7e97be10054451468555d0d): The tree constructor can now properly construct the tree of the dummy HTML document I've been feeding it. It was very rewarding to see the child nodes populate correctly.

# Next Steps
---
1. I hate the In Body state but I have to finish it anyway
---
## Note
---
Every commit in this devlog had at least some work on the tree constructor even if not explicitly mentioned in the change notes.
