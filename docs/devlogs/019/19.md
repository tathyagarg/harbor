# Changes
---
- [aa54f4f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/aa54f4f931ff15618067beb654c15f0365f25a94): Lots of quality of life improvements relating to text rendering:
  - Moved text rendering to a separate text rendering manager
  - Added support for CMAP Subtable Format 12
  - Spent way too much time trying to advance a line height properly
  - Added anti-aliasing support for text rendering
  - Added support for composite glyphs, which included implementing scaling and translation of glyph components

---
# Next Steps
---
1. Move the vertex buffer object to be a property of the text renderer, to make it easier to render multiple things in the future
2. Try to add some filling to the shapes being drawn

## Note
---
I feel like I didn't spend THAT much time on this devlog, but looking back at it I did add a whole lot of features. I have no idea why I didn't commit more often, but it might have something to do with the fact that work on this commit started at 1 AM.
