- [b3661e7](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/b3661e7e9edc845ad878f11bc936e9770b95ae18): I completed CMAP format 6 parsing - it was actually pretty easy. I've learned that font parsing is WAY easier than HTML parsing because they have such a strict format. I can literally just read bytes in order and know exactly what they mean.
- [5d11d0f](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/5d11d0f76c425ac7b13d0cf30a8b9981c99a968e): Added the font header table `head` parsing.
- [0f25790](https://github.com/tathyagarg/harbor/commit/0f257903703c6010580a275381bb082f73b2f4ea): I added parsing for `hhea`, `maxp` and `hmtx` tables. This was actually a lot harder than I expected because the `hmtx` table's length depends on variables defined in the `maxp` and `hhea` tables - but it's not guaranteed that those tables will come before `hmtx` in the file. So I had to set up a deferred parsing system which allowed me to defer parsing of certain tables until their dependencies were parsed.

# Next Steps
---
1. Complete the remaining required tables `name`, `OS/2`, `post`.
2. Start parsing of tables required for glyph outlines - `loca` and `glyf`.
